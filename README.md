# Music_Recommender_System
 # ðŸŽµ Spotify Song Recommender using KNN  
This project is a **music recommendation system** that uses **Spotifyâ€™s API** to fetch song features and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to recommend similar songs. By analyzing **audio attributes** like **danceability, energy, and valence**, the model suggests songs with a similar vibe.  

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **Spotify API Integration** to fetch song metadata and audio features.  
- **KNN algorithm** for recommending similar songs based on feature similarity.  
- Works on songs from Spotifyâ€™s database and an in-memory list of popular songs.
